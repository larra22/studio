# **App Name**: Tomato Time

## Core Features:

- Timer: Configurable pomodoro timer with work and break intervals.
- Task Tracking: Display of current focus task, as well as a log of completed tasks
- Notifications: Options for sound and desktop notifications to signal the start and end of intervals.
- Focus Music: AI-powered focus music recommendations during work intervals, based on user's preferences, and provided via tool-use of an LLM

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep red (#C73E1D) evoking the color of a ripe tomato. It is a color that encourages focus.
- Background color: Very light, desaturated red (#F9EBEA). This provides a gentle backdrop without distracting from the timer.
- Accent color: A soft orange (#D35400), to provide a contrasting highlight.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern, machined, objective, neutral look; suitable for headlines or body text
- Simple, clear icons for settings, task management, and notifications.
- Clean, centered layout with a focus on the timer display. Task list and settings are easily accessible but do not dominate the interface.
- Subtle transitions for timer updates and task completion.
